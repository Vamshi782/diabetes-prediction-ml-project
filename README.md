# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on various health attributes. The goal is to support early intervention and healthcare decisions through predictive analytics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

We used the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes medical predictor variables and one target variable, indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Diabetes is a growing health concern worldwide. Early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to build a predictive model that classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical measurements.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### 📊 Features Used

- Number of Pregnancies  
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin Level  
- BMI (Body Mass Index)  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age

### 🧠 Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was evaluated using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **Confusion Matrix**.

### 📈 Results

The **Random Forest model** outperformed others with the highest accuracy (~83%), followed by KNN and Logistic Regression. We visualized feature importances, model comparisons, and ROC curves.

### 📌 Key Takeaways

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling) plays a crucial role
- Ensemble methods like Random Forest deliver robust performance
- Visualization helped in understanding data patterns and model behavior
